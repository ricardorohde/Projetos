project Name: absDB_dvx45_tibTracker:
2k9aug15sat2347cr:-)
[1] creation of this readME file,
[2] enabled tcxView Navigator ... ok,
[3] "duration" time formatting ...
[2415] added "dbEdit1", how to set various time formats in Delphi without
        coding ...
[2510] tested code HrToStr(rHr:real)
        and need further enhancement to take care of timeStop > 2400 with
        the use of 01:00 to represent 1AM the next day. Hence need to add '24'.
[2420] reset absDB using dateTime instead of Time...

[1225] experimented and found setting in
  cxGrid_DBTableView_timeStop.Properties can have several choices of
  layout like
  timeEdit-> user can change time values with spinners,
  dateEdit-> user can change date via a calendar.
  combobox-> user can change both date_time string style...
    but prone to typo and entry error. its better to use calendar & spinners !
[1240] on_Event present the user with a dialog to use dateEdit or timeEdit, then
  code it. timeStart.onDblClick ... not very intuitive.
[1300] use a cxButton for that purpose ...

[1630]
  [1] using a stand-alone date component: but how to pass the date value to a
  field in the grid ? or even
  [2] cxButton after click : how to set a string into the grid's text field ?
